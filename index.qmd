# üß© Course Structure

We‚Äôll be following a **flipped classroom** strategy:

-   During the week, you‚Äôll study the core concepts at your own pace ‚Äî whether at home, in the library, or even in the park (it‚Äôs the summer term after all!).

-   At the beginning of each seminar, we‚Äôll clear up any open questions before diving into **active problem-solving** and **programming**.

-   Expect a mix of hands-on coding, small-group discussions, and the occasional productive chaos when things don‚Äôt work as expected (that‚Äôs part of the learning process!).


# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

-   Most importantly: Sociological curiosity ‚Äì An interest in social behavior and experiments is essential. If you‚Äôre not genuinely curious about how people behave and why, this course might not be for you! -
-   Basic R programming skills ‚Äì You should be comfortable reading and understanding R code (including functions). You don‚Äôt need to be an expert, but you should know the basics.
-   Laptop ‚Äì Make sure you have R and RStudio installed and running. If you don‚Äôt have a laptop (yes, this can happen!), don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me (sascha.grehl\@uni-leipzig.de) ‚Äî we‚Äôll work something out.
-   Paper and pen ‚Äì Digital or analog, as long as you can sketch out your ideas and map your thoughts. -
-   A sense of humor ‚Äì Things will break, code will crash, and unexpected results will happen ‚Äî that‚Äôs all part of the process.[^1]

[^1]: *A good tip from someone who‚Äôs spent hours raging over broken code:* The problem is 99.99999% of the time sitting **in front of the screen**. You probably made a silly mistake and just aren‚Äôt spotting it right now. Keep calm, drink some tea and relax. In this respect, ChatGPT changed my life ‚Äî just ask it where the error is, and it will usually confront you with your obvious mistake.

# üéì Formal Requirements

In order to sucessfully complete the course the following requirements are to be met:

-   **Pre-examination requirement (*Pr√ºfungsvorleistung*)**: At least 50% of the points in the 6 problem sets (*√úbungsbl√§tter*)
-   **Course assessment (*Pr√ºfungsleistung*)**: The final grade is determined by the assessment of the term paper. (*Hausarbeit*).
