Welcome to the second session of the seminar **Computational Social Sciences**

# Social networks

A **social network** consists of a set of **actors** that are connected by **relationships** in a pairwise manner [@wassermanSocialNetworkAnalysis2009]. Actors can represent individuals, groups, organizations, companies, or even entire countries. The nature of these relationships varies and can be defined in different ways, such as:

-   **Similarity-based relationships** (e.g., shared interests, attributes, or behaviors)
-   **Role- and position-based relationships** (e.g., hierarchies, affiliations, or professional connections)
-   **Resource-transfer relationships** (e.g., exchange of information, goods, or support)

Networks are commonly visualised by **nodes** (usually circles), representing the actors and **edges** (lines or arrows) , representing the relationships.

```{r}


library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate a random graph with 30 nodes and 50 edges
g <- erdos.renyi.game(n = 60, p.or.m = 70, type = "gnm", directed = FALSE)

# Assign random colors to nodes
V(g)$color <- sample(c("blue", "green"), vcount(g), replace = TRUE)

# Assign random sizes to nodes
V(g)$size <- sample(5:12, vcount(g), replace = TRUE)

# Plot the network using ggraph
ggraph(g, layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(color = "lightgray", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = size, color = color), alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue" = "#967bb6", "green" = "#e8bff7")) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")



```

#### Excercise

Reflect briefly on the occasions, where in the past you have been confronted with social networks. In what theoretical concepts of sociology is the embedding of actors of central importance?

## Types of social networks

In social network analysis, we distinguish between **directed** and **undirected** networks. In most real-world cases, **directed networks** are more realistic because relationships are often asymmetric. However, **undirected networks** are easier to analyze mathematically and computationally.

### Directed Networks

Directed networks represent relationships where the connection has a defined direction. These relationships do not necessarily have to be reciprocal.

$$
\forall A,B \in V:(A \to B) \not\Rightarrow (B \to A)
$$

**Examples:**\
- **Social media interactions**: On Twitter or Instagram, one user can follow another without being followed back.\

### Undirected Networks

Undirected networks assume that if a connection exists, it is inherently mutual. These networks are simpler to analyze since they do not require considering directionality.

$$
\forall A, B \in V: (A \leftrightarrow B) \Rightarrow (B \leftrightarrow A)
$$

**Examples:**\
- **Mutual friendships**: In many studies, friendship networks are assumed to be undirected, meaning if A considers B a friend, B also considers A a friend (although this is not always the case in reality).\
- **Co-authorship networks**: If two researchers have co-authored a paper together, the connection exists for both equally.\
- **Collaboration networks**: In corporate or scientific collaborations, individuals or institutions work together on projects, making the relationship inherently bidirectional.

In practice, the choice between directed and undirected networks depends on the research question. If directionality is crucial (e.g., influence, hierarchy, or information flow), a **directed network** is necessary. However, if the goal is to analyze overall connectivity, **undirected networks** provide a simpler approach.
