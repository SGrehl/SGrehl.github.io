Welcome to the second session of the seminar **Computational Social Sciences**
  
# Social networks
  
A **social network** consists of a set of **actors** that are connected by **relationships** in a pairwise manner [@wassermanSocialNetworkAnalysis2009]. Actors can represent individuals, groups, organizations, companies, or even entire countries. The nature of these relationships varies and can be defined in different ways, such as:

- **Similarity-based relationships** (e.g., shared interests, attributes, or behaviors)
- **Role- and position-based relationships** (e.g., hierarchies, affiliations, or professional connections)
- **Resource-transfer relationships** (e.g., exchange of information, goods, or support)
