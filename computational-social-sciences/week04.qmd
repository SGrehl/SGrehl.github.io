# Relational Sociology and the concept of embeddedness

## Reciprocity

Measures of reciprocity are

Dyads



## Transitivity


# Network segregation and homophily

## Segregation
network level property such that edges between predefined groups of vertices are relatively less likely. (netseg package)

Example: Schellings model 

tightly connected to the individual level phenomena homophily

## Homophily


Denotes the social phenomenon that people tend to be similar to their social contacts.

Birds of a feather - Billie Eilish has the same title as one of the most cited homophily papers by McPherson, Smith-Lovin and Cook (2001), where various studies of homophily were summarised. Homophily is observed in regard to race and ethnicity, gender and age, religion, education, occupation and social class, behaviour, and attitudes and beliefs

Definition: from what stage on, can we say a network is homophile?
:::

1. Einstellungshomophily
2. Statushomophily

```{r}


# Check the attributes available in the dataset
vertex_attr_names(UKfaculty)

# Assuming 'Group' is an attribute in the dataset
# Assign different colors to each unique group
group_colors <- rainbow(length(unique(V(UKfaculty)$Group)))

# Create a vector of colors for each vertex based on its group
vertex_colors <- group_colors[V(UKfaculty)$Group]

# Plot the graph with vertex colors based on the 'Group' attribute
plot(UKfaculty, vertex.color = vertex_colors)






```

Measures: 

Let $e_{AB}$ be the number of edges between two types of actors A and B (e.g. different faculties) and $m$ be the total numbers of edges in the network. Then homophily the probability of a connection between a node of the A group and a node of the B group is significantly smaller than in a random network. We can use the **assortavity coefficient** for measurement.

Assortavity coefficients are basically correlation coefficients that (in the case of categorical variables) can be measured by $e_{i,j}$ being the ratio of edge from actors of type $i$ to type $j$

# types are assumed to be integers starting with one

```

or odds-ratios of within-group ties [@bojanowskiMeasuringSegregationSocial2014]

```{r}
orwg(UKfaculty, "Group")
```

telling us, that same-group tie odds are 12.866 times greater than tie odds between groups.

or Colemans Index [@colemanRelationalAnalysisStudy1958] that compares the proportion of same-group neighbours to the proportion of that group in the network as a whole.

```{r}
coleman(UKfaculty, "Group")
```

which compares the proportion of same-group neighbors to the proportion of that group in the network as a whole. It is a number between -1 and 1. Value of 0 means these proportions are equal. Value of 1 means that all ties outgoing from a particular group are sent to the members of the same group. Value of -1 is the opposite â€“ all ties are sent to members of other group(s).
