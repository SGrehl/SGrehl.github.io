## Reciprocity

Measures of reciprocity are based on the **dyad census**: Any pair of vertices in a network is called  a dyad. There are three possible states of dyads (in a directed network): null dyads (no edge), b) asymmetric dyads (one directed edge) and c) mutual dyads (two directed edges).

```{r}
null <- graph_from_literal(1, 2)
as <- graph_from_literal(1-+2)
mutual <- graph_from_literal(1-+2, 2-+1)

g <- graph_from_literal(1-+2, 2-+3, 2+-3, 5-+2, 3--+5, 5-+3, 3-+4)

layout_line <- cbind(1:2, rep(1, 2))

plot(null,
     vertex.color = "lavender",
     vertex.size = 30, 
     layout = layout_line)

plot(as, 
     vertex.color = "lavender",
     vertex.size = 30,
     layout = layout_line)

plot(mutual,
     vertex.color = "lavender",
     vertex.size = 30,
     layout = layout_line)

# Plotte das Netzwerk mit Lavender vertices
plot(g,
     vertex.color = "lavender",
     vertex.size = 30,
     edge.width = 2,
     arrow.size = 0.1,
     layout = layout_with_fr)

```

### Dyad census in a graph

```{r}

UKfaculty <- upgrade_graph(UKfaculty)
UKfaculty <- simplify(UKfaculty)

dyad_census(UKfaculty)
```

The **level of reciprocity** shows whether a network mainly consists of mutual or assymetrical edges and can be calculated in R using either 'default'-mode (number of reciprocated edges divided by the total number of edges) or 'ratio'-mode (number of mutual dyads divided by the number of asymmetric dyads).

```{r}

reciprocity(UKfaculty, mode="default")

reciprocity(UKfaculty, mode="ratio")
```

## Transitivity

Any set of 3 vertices is called a **triad**. In directed networks, 16 different triads exist [@davisStructurePositiveInterpersonal1967].

# Define all 16 triad types using adjacency matrices
triad_matrices <- list(
  matrix(c(0,0,0, 0,0,0, 0,0,0), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE), # 003

:::{#custom-block}
The codes like `102`, `021C`, `120U` may feel cryptic at first, but they follow a logical pattern:

** Basic structure: Three-digit code

- **First digit**: Number of **mutual (reciprocal)** dyads (e.g., A ↔ B)
- **Second digit**: Number of **asymmetric (one-way)** dyads (e.g., A → B)
- **Third digit**: Number of **null dyads** (no tie between the pair)

**Example: '102'**

| Digit | Meaning                                        |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| `1`   | 1 mutual (reciprocal) relationship (e.g., A ↔ B) |
| `0`   | 0 one-way relationships                        |
| `2`   | 2 node pairs have no relationship              |

**Add-On lettering:**

For more complex cases, a letter is added to describe the triad's shape or direction:

| Code     | Description                                                    |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `021D`   | Two one-way edges going **down** (A → B → C)                   |
| `021U`   | Two one-way edges going **up** (C → B → A)                     |
| `021C`   | A **circle** of one-way edges (A → B → C → A)                  |
| `030T`   | A **transitive** triangle (A → B → C and A → C)                |
| `030C`   | A **cycle** with three one-way edges (A → B → C → A)           |
| `120D`   | One mutual edge, two one-way edges in a **downward** direction |
| `120U`   | One mutual edge, two one-way edges in an **upward** direction  |
| `120C`   | A **circle**-like pattern with mutual + one-way ties           |
| `210`    | Two mutual dyads and one one-way edge                          |
| `300`    | All three dyads are mutual (fully connected triad)             |      |

# Network segregation and homophily

## Segregation
network level property such that edges between predefined groups of vertices are relatively less likely. (netseg package)

Example: Schellings model 

tightly connected to the individual level phenomena homophily

## Homophily


Denotes the social phenomenon that people tend to be similar to their social contacts.

Birds of a feather - Billie Eilish has the same title as one of the most cited homophily papers by McPherson, Smith-Lovin and Cook (2001), where various studies of homophily were summarised. Homophily is observed in regard to race and ethnicity, gender and age, religion, education, occupation and social class, behaviour, and attitudes and beliefs

# Check the attributes available in the dataset
vertex_attr_names(UKfaculty)

# Assuming 'Group' is an attribute in the dataset
# Assign different colors to each unique group
group_colors <- rainbow(length(unique(V(UKfaculty)$Group)))

# Create a vector of colors for each vertex based on its group

# Plot the graph with vertex colors based on the 'Group' attribute

Measures: 

Let $e_{AB}$ be the number of edges between two types of actors A and B (e.g. different faculties) and $m$ be the total numbers of edges in the network. Then homophily the probability of a connection between a node of the A group and a node of the B group is significantly smaller than in a random network. We can use the **assortavity coefficient** for measurement.

Assortavity coefficients are basically correlation coefficients that (in the case of categorical variables) can be measured by $e_{i,j}$ being the ratio of edge from actors of type $i$ to type $j$

$$
r = \frac{\sum}{}
$$

```{r}

# types are assumed to be integers starting with one
assortativity_nominal(UKfaculty, types = V(UKfaculty)$Group + 1)

```

or odds-ratios of within-group ties [@bojanowskiMeasuringSegregationSocial2014]

```{r}
orwg(UKfaculty, "Group")
```

telling us, that same-group tie odds are 12.866 times greater than tie odds between groups.

or Colemans Index [@colemanRelationalAnalysisStudy1958] that compares the proportion of same-group neighbours to the proportion of that group in the network as a whole.

```{r}
coleman(UKfaculty, "Group")
```

which compares the proportion of same-group neighbors to the proportion of that group in the network as a whole. It is a number between -1 and 1. Value of 0 means these proportions are equal. Value of 1 means that all ties outgoing from a particular group are sent to the members of the same group. Value of -1 is the opposite – all ties are sent to members of other group(s).





# Social capital

Similarly to homophily, social capital is (though often cited) not as a clear term as it may seem.
