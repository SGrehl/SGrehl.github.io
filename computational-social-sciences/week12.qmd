Spatial thinking refers to reasoning about **location**, **distance**, and **spatial relationships**. It is useful in answering questions such as:

- Are healthcare facilities equally accessible to all neighborhoods?
- Is crime concentrated in specific urban areas?
- Do voting patterns show spatial clustering?

**Spatial dependence** can violate assumptions of classical models (like independence of observations). Recognizing spatial structure allows us to design better models and policies.


Space adds a new way to control for factors that our classic models arguably cannot capture (distance, presence of certain things).
