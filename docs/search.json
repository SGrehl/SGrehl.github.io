    "text": "Welcome to the first session of Computational Social Sciences!\nToday, we will go over the plan for the semester, including:\n\nHow the course materials are organized\nWhat the examination requirements are\nHow we interact and work together in this course\nAnd finally, a short optional R refresher with some key functions that will be important for us. Those who would like to join are very welcome to stay!\n\nLooking forward to a great semester with you all!\n\nIntroduction round\nOnline Umfrage zu verschiedenen Random-Themen und Soziologie Abschluss mit Interessen und Erwartungen\n\n\nR-Refresher\nR is a statistical programming language and environment. It includes thousands of packages for data management, analasys and visualisation. It supports high quality graphic. It is free and open source, there is a large community of R users and developers. Usually new statistical and analytical techniques are quickly available in R\nNew functions can be written and checked by other users\nSupport for network analysis in R and geodata analysis in R (various packages: network, igraph, intergraph, sna, ergm, RSiena), etc.\nFor further informations see Cheat Sheets\n\nRStudio IDE Cheatsheet\nPublish and Share with Quarto\n\n\nInstallation\nIn case you haven`t installed R and RStudio\n\nInstall R\nInstall RStudio\n\nThis is the easiest way, you are of course allowed to use other source code editors (like VSCode, Eclipse, PyCharm, Vim, Emacs or any other preference you might have). I will show the examples in class using RStudio though.\n\n\nGetting started\nCreate a new R Script or R Notebook or Quarto document\nFile –&gt; New File –&gt; chose your option\nWorking directory\n\n# Find the current workind directory (where inputs are found and output are send)\ngetwd()\n\n# Change the current working directory\nsetwd(\"C://file/path\")\n\nWhen we analyze data in R usually we also depend on functions, other users and developers have written, which are usually stored in so called packages. Packages can be installed and called like this:\n\ninstall.packages(\"igraph\")\n\nlibrary(igraph)\n\n\nAccessing help files\n\n# Get help of a particular function\nhelp(rnorm)\n# or\n?rnorm\n\n# Search te help files for a word or a phrase (if you don't know the name of the function)\nhelp.search(\"weighted mean\")\n# or\n??\"weighted mean\"\n\n# Find help for a package\nhelp(package=igraph)\n\n\n\n\nAtomic datatypes in R\nAtomic in this case means the data is of size = 1.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\ninteger\nWhole numbers\n5\n\n\nnumeric\nDecimal numbers\n4.2\n\n\nlogic\nBoolean values\nTRUE, FALSE\n\n\ncharacter\nText or string values\n\"Hello\"\n\n\nNA\nMissing value indicator\nNA\n\n\nNULL\nAbsence of a value/object\nNULL\n\n\nNaN\nNot a number (e.g. 0/0)\nNaN\n\n\nInf\nPositive or negative infinity\nInf, -Inf\n\n\n\nChecking types\n\nint &lt;- as.integer(42)\nnum &lt;- 42.1\nlog &lt;- TRUE\nchar &lt;- \"Hello\"\n\nclass(int)\nclass(num)\nclass(log)\nclass(char)\n\n\n\nBasic Operations\nArithmetic operations\n\n# Addition\n2 + 7\n\n# Substraction\n4 - 2\n\n# Multiplication\n5 * 2\n\n# Division\n8 / 2\n\n# Natural log\nlog(2)\n\n# Exponentation\n2^3\n\n# Exponential\nexp(7)\n\n# Round to nearest integer\nfloor(4.8)\nceiling(4.8)\n\n# Round\nround(7.5)\n\n\n\nObjects & Structured Data Types\nValues can be stored in Variables.

    "text": "Types of social networks\nIn social network analysis, we distinguish between directed and undirected networks. In most real-world cases, directed networks are more realistic because relationships are often asymmetric. However, undirected networks are easier to analyze mathematically and computationally.\n\nDirected Networks\nDirected networks represent relationships where the connection has a defined direction. These relationships do not necessarily have to be reciprocal.\n\\[\n\\forall A,B \\in V:(A \\to B) \\not\\Rightarrow (B \\to A)\n\\]\nExamples:\n- Social media interactions: On Twitter or Instagram, one user can follow another without being followed back.\n- Communication networks: E-Mails, phone calls or other forms of communication, can be sent out or received, thus defining a direction.\n\n\nUndirected Networks\nUndirected networks assume that if a connection exists, it is inherently mutual. These networks are simpler to analyze since they do not require considering directionality.\n\\[\n\\forall A, B \\in V: (A \\leftrightarrow B) \\Rightarrow (B \\leftrightarrow A)\n\\]\nExamples:\n- Mutual friendships: In many studies, friendship networks are assumed to be undirected, meaning if A considers B a friend, B also considers A a friend (although this is not always the case in reality).\n- Co-authorship networks: If two researchers have co-authored a paper together, the connection exists for both equally.\n- Collaboration networks: In corporate or scientific collaborations, individuals or institutions work together on projects, making the relationship inherently bidirectional.\nIn practice, the choice between directed and undirected networks depends on the research question. If directionality is crucial (e.g., influence, hierarchy, or information flow), a directed network is necessary. However, if the goal is to analyze overall connectivity, undirected networks provide a simpler approach.\n\nlibrary(patchwork)  # For arranging plots\n\n\n# Generate a random graph with 30 nodes and 50 edges\ng2 &lt;- erdos.renyi.game(n = 60, p.or.m = 70, type = \"gnm\", directed = TRUE)\n\n# Assign random colors to nodes\nV(g2)$color &lt;- sample(c(\"blue\", \"green\"), vcount(g2), replace = TRUE)\n\n# Assign random sizes to nodes\nV(g2)$size &lt;- sample(5:12, vcount(g2), replace = TRUE)\n\n  # Plot the network using ggraph\np1 &lt;- ggraph(g, layout = \"fr\") + \n      geom_edge_link(color = \"lightgray\", alpha = 0.5) +\n      geom_node_point(aes(size = size, color = color), alpha = 0.8) +\n      scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\" = \"#967bb6\", \"green\" = \"#e8bff7\")) +\n      theme_void() +\n      theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n      ggtitle(\"Undirected Network\")\n\n# Create the directed network plot\np2 &lt;- ggraph(g2, layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1.5, \"mm\"), type = \"closed\"), color = \"lightgray\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = size, color = color), alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\" = \"#967bb6\", \"green\" = \"#e8bff7\")) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Directed Network\")\n\n# Arrange the two plots side by side\np1 + p2"

    "text": "Welcome to the Computational Social Science (CSS) seminar! This hands-on course explores how social network analysis and geo/spatial data can enhance our understanding of society. Using R, we will learn techniques for visualizing, analyzing, and integrating these data types with existing datasets—such as survey or experimental data — to gain deeper insights into social phenomena.\n\nGeneral Information\n\n\n\nMonday, weekly\n15:15 - 16:45\n\n\nGWZ, H2 1.15\nStart: 4/7/25\n\n\n\n\nOur focus will be twofold:\n\nSocial Network Analysis: Understanding relationships and structures in network data, applying visualization techniques, and conducting empirical analyses.\nGeo/Spatial Data Analysis: Examining spatial patterns and dependencies, and leveraging location-based data for social science research.\n\nBy combining these data sources with traditional and emerging approaches—including text data (next Semester with Felix) and simulated data (this semester with Sascha) —we will explore innovative ways to study societal dynamics. Throughout the seminar, we will engage with inspiring case studies and hands-on applications to develop our own research perspectives.\nThis course provides both conceptual and technical foundations for working with computational methods in the social sciences, empowering participants to extend existing datasets and refine their analytical toolkit.\n\nAbout me\n\nForschungsgebiet\nMasterarbeit über Netztwerke\nErreichbarkeit und Sprechstunde\n\n\n\nCourse Goals\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nSyllabus\n\n\n\nDate\nWeek\nSubject\nContent\nLiterature and Materials\n\n\n\n\n07.04.2025\n1\nKick-Off\n\nIntroduction\nCourse Setup and Structure\n\nBackground Materials\nData Overview\n\nR-Refresher\n\n\nBasic R von Veronika Batzdörfer\nhttps://missing.csail.mit.edu/\n\n\n\n14.04.2025\n2\nNetworkanalysis in R\n\nSocial Networks\nIntroduction to Social Networkanalysis in R\n\nRepresentation of networks\nNetwork Attributes\n\nHandling missing data\n\nNetwork Data in R\nWasserman und Faust\nSocial Network Analysis 101: Ultimate Guide - Visible Network Labs\n\n\n21.04.2025\n3\nno lecture (Ostermontag)\n\n\n\n\n28.04.2025\n4\nKey Metrics and theoretical Insight\n\nDescriptives\nCentrality and Assortavity\nHomophily\nHierarchy\n\n\n\n\n05.05.2025\n5\nNetwork Visualisation\n\nVisualisation basics\nInteractive visualisation\n\nZschache\nProperties of real life netwirks\n\n\n12.05.2025\n6\nCommunity Detection & Structural Comparison\n\nAufgaben in Yans (Linköping) Skript\nRossweil: infomap\nPNAS - Algorithmen\nEigene Masterarbeit\n\n\n19.05.2025\n7\nStatistical Models & Case Studies\n\nERGMs\n\nIntroduction to ERGMs | Social Network Analysis for Anthropologists\n\nSpiegelMining – Reverse Engineering von Spiegel-Online (33c3)\n(Bodaghi and Oliveira 2022)\nInternationale Flugverbindungen\nVerbreitung - ABM\nZune Lehmann aus Kopenhagen\n\n\n\n26.05.2025\n8\nOpen Lab Session\n\nQ&A\nDiscussions\nTerm Paper ideas\n\n\n\n\n02.06.2025\n9\nGeo-Data Analysis\n\nIntroduction to spatial data\nBasics in R\n\n(Logan 2012)]\n(Criado-Perez 2019)\n\nOpen Street Map Data\nGIS-Daten\nsf-package\nUsing Spatial Data with\n\n\n\n09.06.2025\n10\nno lecture (Pfingstmontag)\n\n\n\n\n16.06.2025\n11\nSpatial data visualisation in R\nSpatial Inference\n\nVisualisation\nSpatial inference\n\n\nWetterdaten auf Surveyanswers oder so\n\n\n\n23.06.2025\n12\nCase Studies in Geodata Analysis\n\nCA Bail - Using Internet search data to examine the relationship between anti-Muslim and pro -Isis sentiment in US counties\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nRead at home, rather discussion of method, usability, etc.\nAround the world - with discussion\n\nGIS-Daten Stichprobenziehung\n\n\n\n30.06.2025\n13\nOpen Science and Computational Social Science: Tools, Ethics, and Best Practices\n\n\nKurs von Christian\n- Github,\n- Quarto\n-\nOSF, etc.\nBest Practices, Ethische Herausforderungen, etc.\n\nDiskussion\n\nRaum für ganz kurze Inputvorträge, falls sich schon Gruppen gebildet haben\n\nOpen Science\n\n\n\n07.07.2025\n14\nPresentations and discussion term paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Material\n\nFelix Lennert\nChristian Czymara\nVeronika Batzdörfer\nTill Hovestadt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBodaghi, Amirhosein, and Jonice Oliveira. 2022. “The Theater of Fake News Spreading, Who Plays Which Role?
