    "text": "Welcome to the second session of the seminar Computational Social Sciences\n\nSocial networks\nA social network consists of a set of actors that are connected by relationships in a pairwise manner (Wasserman and Faust 2009). Actors can represent individuals, groups, organizations, companies, or even entire countries. The nature of these relationships varies and can be defined in different ways, such as:\n\nSimilarity-based relationships (e.g., shared interests, attributes, or behaviors)\nRole- and position-based relationships (e.g., hierarchies, affiliations, or professional connections)\nResource-transfer relationships (e.g., exchange of information, goods, or support)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWasserman, Stanley, and Katherine Faust. 2009.
