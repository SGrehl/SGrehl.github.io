  subtitle: "Analytical Solutions & Hypotheses"

# Introduction

This week we will deal with analytical solutions and how we can use them to derive hypotheses in detail.

## üéØ Learning Goals

By the end of this week, you should:

-   Know the difference between **hypotheses** and **propositions**.

-   Understand why **analytical solutions are valuable** in the social sciences.

-   Recognize the **limitations of analytical solutions** when applied to complex social situations.

-   Be able to model a simple social interaction using **Game Theory**.

-   Understand how to introduce **bounded rationality**.

# Propositions & Hypotheses

Proposition: Universal statement about the relationship between one or more concepts Hypothesis: Singular statement, derived from propositions, concretely related to investigation - Social capital increases academic success - The higher the parents' educational attainment, the better the children's German score Important: We test hypotheses, not propositions. In order to test them we have to run (in the ideal case) experiments!

## Derivation of a hypothesis

### üß† Why Analytical Solutions Matter

Analytical solutions (often expressed as equations) are the **gold standard** in science because:

-   They provide **precise** answers.

-   They allow for **clear causal interpretation**.

-   They have a high **objectivity, transparency and reproducibility**.

-   They are often **computationally fast**.

### üöß **Shortcomings of Analytical Solutions**

However, in the social sciences, analytical solutions can become difficult because:

Reality too complex to be captured analytically in its entirety Theories (and the respective equations) can capture only partial aspects of reality. Yet, Sometimes we want a complex, multifaceted analysis Combination of theories not necessarily analytically compatible or manageable

-   Models of social behavior often become too **complex** to solve analytically.

-   Human behavior introduces **noise** and **irrationality**.

Therefore we will look in two weeks at another approach, namly numerical solutions (e.g. simulations).

# üé≤ Modeling Social Situations

A first step to derive of a analyitical solution is to set up a model, that later can be analyzed. For this pourpse we will use a very straight forward model namely decision and game theory.

## Game Theory

Game theory offers a structured approach to modeling social situations:

-   **Players** ‚Äì Agents making decisions.

-   **Strategies** ‚Äì Options available to the players.

-   **Payoffs** ‚Äì Outcomes based on strategy combinations.

üëâ *Example:* The Prisoner's Dilemma ‚Äì A simple two-player game that reveals the challenge of cooperation and competition.

## üîé **Bounded Rationality**

-   Classical game theory assumes **perfectly rational actors**.

-   In reality, humans often make decisions based on incomplete information and cognitive limitations (bounded rationality).

-   Introducing bounded rationality increases complexity ‚Äî solutions become harder to compute.

    ## üé≤ Game Theory ‚Äì Modeling Social Situations

    **Game theory** provides a structured framework: - **Players** ‚Äì Decision-makers. - **Strategies** ‚Äì Options available. - **Payoffs** ‚Äì Outcomes based on strategy combinations.

    ### Example: The Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma

    -   Cooperation vs. defection.
    -   Payoffs depend on combined strategies.
    -   Nash equilibrium as a solution concept.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ## ü§Ø Bounded Rationality

    -   Classical game theory assumes **perfect rationality**.
    -   Bounded rationality = Limited information + Cognitive limitations.
    -   Makes solutions more complex and realistic.

# üèãÔ∏è **Pre-Class Assignment**

1.  Read the assigned material (TBA).

2.  Solve the following simple problem:

    -   Imagine a coordination problem between two firms deciding whether to invest in a new market. Create a simple payoff matrix and identify the Nash equilibrium.

    -   Then, modify the problem by introducing **bounded rationality** (e.g., one firm lacks full information). How does the equilibrium change?

3.  Bring your results and any questions to the seminar.
